/*Think of it like this:
Box Number (i)	Question	Answer in Box

0	           What is C?	        A
1	           What is a char?	    C
2	           What is an array? 	A

The program goes one box at a time â€” when it opens box 1 (i = 1),
it uses the question from box 1 and expects the answer from box 1 (answers[1]).*/
